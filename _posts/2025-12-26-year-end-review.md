challenges
1. Keeping up with my weekly goal of writing a post
    - sometimes I am too busy and couldn't find time to write a post at times up to a month. 
    - Had to backdate some of the posts
1. Had difficulty finding ideas for a post
    - Sometimes it doesn't need to be a big idea
    - Could be something as simple as what is on my mind
