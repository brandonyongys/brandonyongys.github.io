For the past few months, I have been going through a series of interviews, as an interviewer as well as an interviewee. 

as an interviewer, know what i am looking for - technical competence. given it is an entry level position, not expecting experience but good theoretical understanding of the techniques. drilled down on their projects to test how far and much they know.
looked out for red flags. no smirking, condescending expression etc.

different from supervisor who's looking for a female colleague to balance out the team (1 F vs 4 M).


AS an interviewee, interviewed for a range of companies, ranging pharma to airlines.

technical assessment
    - data structure - no experience and couldn't remember much about the O() things about run time.
    - SQL - have very little exposure. had to rely on Chat GPT to write out somewhat functional SQL. couldn't do more complex.
    - logistic regression - ask about regularization. What happens to beta_0 and beta_j if lambda increases. 

MSD:
    - API - what are APIs? tested to read a script and explain briefly what's happening. sugegst a few things to improve it - couldn't answer
    - NLP experience - little exposure other than theory.
    - good explanation on projects but values aren't being delivered yet.
    - cloud technology experience - don't have. Working towards getting AWS and played around with EB. Need to work with S3 and sage maker.

Compensation:
    - asking for 7.5k but may be too high for Bangkok.
