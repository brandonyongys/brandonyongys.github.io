For the past few months, I have been going through a series of interviews, as an interviewer as well as an interviewee. 

AS an interviewee, interviewed for a range of companies, ranging pharma to airlines.
technical assessment
    - data structure - no experience and couldn't remember much about the O() things about run time.
    - SQL - have very little exposure. had to rely on Chat GPT to write out somewhat functional SQL. couldn't do more complex.
    - logistic regression - ask about regularization. What happens to beta_0 and beta_j if lambda increases. 

MSD:
    - API - what are APIs? tested to read a script and explain briefly what's happening. sugegst a few things to improve it - couldn't answer
    - NLP experience - little exposure other than theory.
    - good explanation on projects but values aren't being delivered yet.
    - cloud technology experience - don't have. Working towards getting AWS and played around with EB. Need to work with S3 and sage maker. 

Compensation:
    - asking for 7.5k but may be too high.
