# Where Do I See Myself in 3-5 Years?
I've been asked this question in interviews before: "_Where do you see yourself in 3-5 years?_"

Sometimes, I give a safe answer - improving my programming skills, working on my communication, maybe getting a house, having better work-life balance. You know, the usual things that should always be a work in progress, no matter where I am in life.

Other times, I'm honest. I say that I want to eventually lead my own team - whether it's for a chatbot project or something bigger, like heading a data science team. But I've also said this to actual team leads, which in hindsight might have sounded like "_I'm aiming for your job._" Awkward? Maybe. But it's the truth.

And honestly, I don't think I should feel embarrassed about it. It's where I want to go. Having a clear goal keeps me on track, shaping the work I do and the skills I develop. But I'll admit - there are times when I forget about my own direction and just go with the flow, reacting to what my stakeholders need. And when I stop to think about it... I'm not even sure of the exact steps to get where I want to be.

# Am I Ready to Lead a Team?
Yes and no.

On one hand, I've built up enough experience to lead major projects, break down tasks, and execute with the tech stack we have. I know how to plan milestones and see things through.

On the other hand, there are gaps - big ones. I don't have much experience handling uncertainty, especially from the admin and financial side of things. There are still technical areas I struggle with, like networking, performance optimization, and building a proper CI/CD pipeline.

Maybe the real question isn't whether I'm ready, but how I get there. And that's something I'll have to figure out - one step at a time. I may not have all the answers now, but the goal is clear. The next step? Filling in the gaps - whether it's technical skills, leadership experience, or just learning how to navigate the unknown.
