New year, new me eh. I have been rather slack in my own professional development for the past 1 year (not only that actually). Now I have to focus and achieve at least 75% of goals by end of the year! No more procrastinating! Below are the goals for the 3 main sections - Professional, Career and Personal.

Professional (Target: 4/5):
1. Monthly post on github page by the last day of the month (12 posts in total)
1. Complete the friends' analysis by January.
1. Deploy a dashboard using one of the dataset in Data.gov.sg using API and AWS in Q2. 
1. Develop and deploy a food image generator in Q3.
1. Develop and deploy a medical image generator in Q4.

Career (Target: 3/3):
1. Deploy the Prophet model for the hospital within the timeline (May 2023)
1. Develop a model that takes in irregular inputs for prediction by Q2.
1. Find an employer that better recognizes the work I've done so far.

Personal (Target 3/4):
1. Travel to Turkey in February.
1. Travel to UK in November.
1. Lose body fats by reducing body fats percentage from 20% to 15% (body weight to decrease from 77kg to 73kg).
1. Be healthier by eating more fruits, veggies and meat for 80% of the meals while reducing carbs intake to lose body fats (aim to drop to 68 kg)

Technically both professional and career goals could be combined into one section. However, I decided to split them up into two because the first half is meant to build up my own data science portfolio and the other half is meant for the company purpose.

These goals were created using the SMART (Specific, Measureable, Archieveable, Relevant and Time-based) method and I now have a clearer picture of what do and achieve each month. Fingers crossed that I could achieve at least 75% of each section.
