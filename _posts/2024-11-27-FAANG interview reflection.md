Recently I had the opportunity to interview for a data science position at one of the FAANG companies. It was an unexpected interview opportunity as I did not think that I was good enough to get one. Well, someone did think I was good enough based on my resume. Spoiler alert! My performance was not good enough to pass the phone interview.

Well, I was in the session with no expectation. The interviewer was very nice as he explained to me the recruitment process and also the interview process. 

Anyway, I am not here to talk about my performance but rather what I have come to realize. As we got into the technical assessment, I come to realize that I still love doing data science. I miss doing all those data preprocessing and preparation, training and fine tuning models and see how the model's performance is against a real person. This is something is not actively offered to me in my current role.

Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my current role where I write codes to develop and enhance the chatbot and also various clinical tools, and also deploying my apps knowing that my apps would serve the healthcare cluster and improve the process. No doubt that I have gained practical hands-on experience that I would not trade it for.

But at the end of the day, I still miss doing data science. Thankfully I did not waste the session and decided to ask the interviewer on his general feedback.

# Feedback 1: You've got to get out of the healthcare industry

He does not mean that the healthcare industry is a terrible place to work. Rather, he is suggesting me to get out of the healthcare industry and work in other industries to gain more insights and gain more exposure. This is what my friends have been telling me as well. And I do not disagree with any of them. I myself enjoy working in the healthcare industry, knowing that my apps would be beneficial to everyone eventually. 

However, it may not be a good thing for my career development given that I am still in the early stage of my career. I have been meaning to leave for a while now but I have yet to find opportunities that excite me.

# Feedback 2: Learn MLOps

He agrees that my data science knowledge is rather good as I was able to answer all of the data science questions. However, given that my prior experience has been more of the model development, I am lacking knowledge and experience in the model deployment and monitoring phase. Hence, he suggested for me to learn more about MLOps. I could run simple model development and deployment. Heck, I could go online and read up on the theoretical concepts. That would be more helpful than not knowing anything at all and keep waiting for an opportunity to gain hands-on experience.

We both acknowledged that computational power would be challenging but I could always use one of the cloud service provider to run the model development and deployment in a low cost setting. 

# Feedback 3: Learn GenAI and LLM

I am aware that I am lacking a lot of knowledge in the GenAI and LLM portion given the hype and also my interest in the NLP. He suggested for me to pick up LLM and learn who to fine tune them. I could tie this in with my personal supermarket project that I am running now and also tie it back with the feedback above.

That is all the feedbacks I got and I would use them as the basis for my next improvement phase.

I recently had the unexpected opportunity to interview for a data science role at one of the FAANG companies. While I didn’t pass the phone interview, the experience was invaluable and gave me a lot to think about.

The process itself was insightful. The interviewer was professional and clear about the recruitment and interview structure. As we delved into the technical assessment, I found myself realizing how much I genuinely enjoy data science. I’ve missed working on data preprocessing, model training, fine-tuning, and evaluating model performanc - tasks I haven't had the opportunity to focus on in my current role.

My present position involves developing and enhancing chatbot systems and clinical tools, as well as deploying applications that benefit the healthcare sector. This work has been incredibly rewarding and has given me practical, hands-on experience that I deeply value. However, it’s become clear to me that I still have a strong passion for core data science work.

During the interview, I also took the chance to ask for general feedback, which I found incredibly valuable. Here are the key takeaways:

### 1. Broaden Industry Exposure
The interviewer suggested that I explore opportunities outside of the healthcare industry. While healthcare has been a fulfilling domain for me, broadening my horizons could provide diverse experiences and new challenges that enhance my skills. This aligns with advice I’ve received from peers as well. At this stage in my career, exploring different industries could be pivotal for growth and development.

### 2. Strengthen MLOps Knowledge
While my data science foundations are strong, the interviewer noted that I could improve in areas related to model deployment and monitoring - essential aspects of MLOps. He emphasized the importance of understanding both the theory and practice of MLOps, even in small-scale projects. Leveraging cloud services for low-cost experimentation was also recommended, as it could bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application.

### 3. Dive into Generative AI and LLMs
Given the rapid advancements in Generative AI and large language models (LLMs), the interviewer encouraged me to deepen my knowledge in these areas, especially as they align with my interest in NLP. Learning to fine-tune LLMs and applying them to personal projects could be a meaningful way to gain hands-on experience and stay relevant in the field.

These insights have given me a clearer path for growth. While I am proud of the work I’ve done so far, I am excited to focus on improving my skills in these areas, tying them into both professional and personal projects as I move forward.

This feedback is now a guiding framework for my next steps in becoming a more well-rounded data scientist.
