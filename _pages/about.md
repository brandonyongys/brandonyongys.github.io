# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

üëã Hi, I'm Brandon ‚Äî a backend & cloud engineer working in Singapore's public healthcare system. I've worn many hats across data engineering, app development, and infrastructure, and these days I'm most excited about building AI systems that actually do something useful.

By day, I build real-world tools for clinicians and patients: WhatsApp health chatbots, food logging pipelines, clinical decision support APIs, and LLM workflows that try to make sense of messy medical data. I've shipped production systems across Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, and Django ‚Äî but I'm most in my element building scrappy, serverless pipelines that just work.

My journey started in logistics and academia, detoured through data science, and landed in healthcare. Along the way, I picked up some AWS certs, a love for automating things, and a healthy respect for every bug, bottleneck, and burnout that's made me better.

üß™ Side Projects I Tinker With
* Supermarket Price Tracker ‚Äì A scraper + MySQL + Telegram chatbot that lets you check product prices from major supermarkets.
* RAG Banking Assistant ‚Äì A chatbot that answers Singapore credit card and banking FAQs using embeddings + OpenSearch + LLMs.
* LLM playgrounds ‚Äì Always experimenting with retrieval strategies, prompt tuning, and how to make LLMs less‚Ä¶ dumb.

‚öôÔ∏è What I'm Into
* AWS, Python, Django, Docker, Kubernetes
* Exploring Golang for backend systems
* Building scrappy but useful prototypes
* Learning more about AI infrastructure and deployment patterns
* Automating boring stuff

Outside of tech, I'm probably deep in a Reddit rabbit hole, reading about financial independence, or daydreaming about chasing auroras in some freezing corner of the world.

üõ†Ô∏è This blog is called **Build, Break, Rebuild** because that's exactly how my systems (and skills) have evolved - one failure at a time.

Feel free to check out my projects or say hi!
