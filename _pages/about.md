# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hi, I'm Brandon! I'm an IT professional working in public healthcare, with a strong background in data science, data engineering, and application development. While my current role focuses more on app development and data engineering, I'm eager to transition back into data science, particularly in LLMs, model deployment, and AI infrastructure.

I've worked across multiple industries - including logistics, education, and healthcare - building and deploying data-driven solutions. In healthcare, I've led projects involving chatbots, clinician decision support systems, food logging pipelines, and AWS cloud solutions. I enjoy being hands-on in both modeling and deployment, with a growing interest in AWS architecture, Golang, and Docker to enhance my cloud and backend skills.

Outside of work, I love building personal projects that combine data, automation, and real-world utility. Some of my current projects include:
1. A supermarket price tracking pipeline that scrapes, processes, and serves price data via a Telegram chatbot.
1. A RAG-based chatbot to simplify banking product research by answering questions about savings accounts, interest rates, and more.

When I'm not coding, I'm probably browsing Reddit, exploring ways to optimize my finances, or planning my next adventureâ€”one day, I hope to see the aurora at the North or South Pole.

Feel free to check out my projects or reach out if you'd like to connect!
