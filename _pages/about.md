# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

Hello! Welcome to my humble github page. I'm Brandon and this is where you could find some of the work I have worked on on or currently working on. It would be updated from time to time as I am focusing most of my time on my meaningful work as a data scientist as well as living my life to the fullest. 

My meaningful work as a data scientist started at Singapore General Hospital in the mid of COVID-19, which is where I am still at! It has been an amazing journey as I was unknowingly the first member of the team and I had to develop the team with guidance from many people. I am now leading the ever growing team (from 3 to 6!) as a technical lead. It is also where I got know a lot of like-minded people who wish to contribute back to the public good. 

Whenever I have some down time here and there, I enjoy reading [reddit](http://reddit.com) especially the [SGreddit](http://https://reddit.com/r/singapore/) as well as to start planning my next escape. One of my to-do list is to visit the North or South Pole! And also, see the aurora with my own eyes. The world is huge and definitely is my oyster.

At the moment, I am still setting up my github. So pardon the tardiness.

If you ever wish to contact me, you could scroll down and choose your poison.
