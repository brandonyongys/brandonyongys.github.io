# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

üëã Hi, I'm Brandon ‚Äî a backend & cloud engineer working in Singapore's public healthcare system. I wear many hats across data engineering, app development, and cloud infrastructure, with a growing passion for large language models (LLMs) and AI systems that actually do useful things.

By day, I build real-world tools for clinicians and patients ‚Äî like WhatsApp-based health chatbots, food logging platforms, clinical decision support APIs, and LLM pipelines that help make sense of messy drug data. I've deployed production systems across Kubernetes, AWS Lambda, and Django, and I'm especially hands-on with building scalable serverless pipelines using the AWS stack.

I started my career in logistics and academia, then transitioned into healthcare ‚Äî and along the way, picked up a few AWS certifications, a love for automating things, and a decent collection of side projects.

üß™ Side Projects I Tinker With
* Supermarket Price Tracker ‚Äì A scraper + MySQL + Telegram chatbot that lets you check product prices from major supermarkets.
* RAG Banking Assistant ‚Äì A chatbot that answers Singapore credit card and banking FAQs using embeddings + OpenSearch + LLMs.
* LLM playgrounds ‚Äì Always experimenting with retrieval strategies, prompt tuning, and how to make LLMs less‚Ä¶ dumb.

‚öôÔ∏è What I'm Into
* AWS, Python, Django, Docker, Kubernetes
* Exploring Golang for backend systems
* Building scrappy but useful prototypes
* Learning more about AI infrastructure and deployment patterns
* Automating boring stuff

When I'm not working, you'll probably find me reading about financial independence, lurking on Reddit, or planning my dream trip to see the aurora somewhere cold.

üõ†Ô∏è This blog is called **Build, Break, Rebuild** because that's exactly how my systems (and skills) have evolved - one failure at a time.

Feel free to check out my projects or say hi!
